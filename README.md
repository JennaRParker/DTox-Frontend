# DTox
A web app to help inform users on what toxic chemicals may be in their everyday lives.  We break it down into three types of products: 
- Food
- Cleaning Supplies
- Other Household or Beauty Products

As users enter the app they will be able to click on one of the three categories above through the navigation bar.  They will then be directed to a list of chemicals found in those products as well as a section to keep track of alternatives products that don't contain these chemicals. Users can create, read, and delete these alternatives.

Each chemical in the list can be clicked on, which will lead users to a page that describes the chemical, and lists a few products that contain that specific chemical.
